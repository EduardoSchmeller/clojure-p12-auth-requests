# SSL Clojure

This Clojure code provides functions for working with SSL certificates, allowing the creation of an SSL context from a P12 certificate file and the creation of an SSL engine from that context.

## Features

- **p12-cert->ssl-context:** Transforms an InputStream providing a P12 certificate into an SSL context.
- **generate-ssl-context:** Builds an SSL context from a given certificate file path.
- **create-ssl-engine:** Builds an SSL engine from a given SSL context.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have a P12 certificate file available. You can then call the `create-ssl-engine` function passing the result of the `generate-ssl-context` function, which in turn uses the `p12-cert->ssl-context` function.

```clojure
(create-ssl-engine (generate-ssl-context "/path/to/your/certificate/file.p12"))
```

Make sure to replace `"/path/to/your/certificate/file.p12"` with the correct path to your P12 certificate file.

## Glossary

- **P12:** File format that contains a digital certificate and its private key.
- **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer):** Security protocol that provides secure communications over the internet.
- **SSL Context:** Object that holds security information, such as certificates and keys, needed to establish an SSL connection.
- **SSL Engine:** Implementation of a security mechanism that handles SSL communication.
